# Project -title
This system is designed to monitor the movement of ambulances throughout the suburban area. As Chiang rai stands as the second-largest city in the northern region with a significant suburban population, recent data indicates a 10 % rise in the risk of accidents compared to the previous year. Motor vehicle accidents top the list, followed by chronic paralysis, illness, and fatigue. Therefore, it is crucial to implement an effective emergency medical system to ensure swift and timely access to services for those in need.
